# Eclipse Library
A Library of functions and definitions for vexide programs.

# What is Vexide
"vexide is a no_std Rust runtime for VEX V5 robots. It allows the code that you write to run on the V5 Brain and control devices like motors and sensors. You can think of it as an alternative to PROS or VEXcode, but for the Rust programming language (rather than C or C++). vexide handles low-level features like task scheduling, memory allocation, competition state, etcâ€¦ that allows your code to run seamlessly on the Brain" (vexide.dev). 

# Why Eclipse Lib?
Eclipse lib was developed to make Vexide slightly more approchable, vexide by its default is very Do it Yourself. while this allows much more freedom than with Vexcode or Pros. it is a double edged sword. Eclipse lib aims to provide a system of constructs and functions to get started and make using vexide more approachable
